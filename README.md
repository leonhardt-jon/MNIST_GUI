# MNIST_GUI
Draw MNIST digits and classify in real time!
Fun weekend project and learning experience. Full scope of project:
1. Trained CNN in pytorch on MNIST images
2. Custom binary dataloader to load weights (Just felt like it / wanted to reduce dependencies)
3. Implemented CNN forward pass in C++ (cnn.cpp)
4. Built GUI using dearImgui
